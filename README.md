Inspired by [recent work](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/24/your-smartphone-will-soon-know-if-you-have-bipolar-disorder) from the University of Michigan, we built an app that provides a speech based interface for figuring out what your symptoms may relate to. Our model which we trained on Wikipedia summaries suggested by CMU's [NELL](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/) Knowledge Engine helps visualize disease likelihoods and severity scores given an unstructured textual input.
